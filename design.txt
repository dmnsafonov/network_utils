First byte of the formats lies on the first byte of the "Indetifier" ICMPv6
Echo Request field.

Datagram format is:
2-byte checksum | 2-byte length | payload

Stream format for the client is:
2-byte checksum | 1's byte | flags byte | 2-byte sequence number | payload
2 bytes is enough to have timely acks for transmitting 1280-byte packets
on 10Gbit link with 2-second ping which is highly unlikely for an icmp tunnel
anyway.

Stream format for the server is:
2-byte checksum | 1's byte | flags byte | 2-byte starting sequence number
    | 2-byte ending sequence number | payload

flags are: S | A | F | WS | 0..
WS flag is 'window sync:' everything before the start_seqno is acked by it.
In a sense, it is like the TCP ACK.

The connection establishing sequence is the standard SYN -> SYN+ACK -> ACK.
The connection is simplex, except for the first SYN+ACK, because we
cannot receive much more packets from the server than are sent by the client.
So, the termination sequence is simply FIN -> FIN+ACK -> ACK.
The first SYN+ACK can carry a simple message that fits in one packet.

To acknowledge a block of packets from the first received to seqno, the ACK
packet must contain two equivalent seqno numbers.  To acknowledge a block
of packets, one must set the starting end ending seqno's.  If the ending seqno
is less that the starting seqno, or the block up to 2^16-1 seqno
is acknowledged, it is interpreted as wraparound of the sequence numbers.
To signal acknowledgement of receipt of more that 2^16-1 packets, one must
acknowledge blocks of 2^16-2 (2^16-1) packets like mentioned in that clause.

All packets MUST have a valid seqno.  Packets, otherwise valid, containing
a wrong seqno MUST be discarded.

The connection termination may be requested by the server
with a FIN -> FIN+ACK -> ACK.  If the server initiated termination
contains the ACK flag, than the sequence numbers must be valid newly
acknowledged seqnos; otherwise the seqno must be the seqno of the last packet
of the block [first_packet, seqno] of packets, receipt of which
was acknowledged.
