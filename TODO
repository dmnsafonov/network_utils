try the enumflags crate to replace the numeric_enums internal one.

maybe, remake the async sockets using macros

migrate to failure

add packet number (u64) in the stream to the checksum

cleanup() in AckWait's pub fn iter()

do something with the timeouts/constants

convert to byteorder

send ack immediately if what we are receiving is a retrans

now that rust has inclusive ranges, remove IRange
