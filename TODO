try the enumflags crate to replace the numeric_enums internal one.

maybe, remake the async sockets using macros

migrate to failure

add packet number (u64) in the stream to the checksum

retransmit lost ack's: send two equal seqno ack with the window start
as from the point of the receiver

cleanup() in AckWait's pub fn iter()

do something with the timeouts/constants

convert to bytes/byteorder

send ack immediately if what we are receiving is a retrans

now that rust has inclusive ranges, remove IRange
